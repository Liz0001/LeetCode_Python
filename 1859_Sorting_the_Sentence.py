1859. Sorting the Sentence from Leetcode.

A sentence is a list of words that are separated
by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

A sentence can be shuffled by appending the 1-indexed word
position to each word then rearranging the words in the sentence.

For example, the sentence "This is a sentence" can be shuffled
as "sentence4 a3 is2 This1" or "is2 sentence4 This1 a3".
Given a shuffled sentence s containing no more than 9 words,
reconstruct and return the original sentence.
